# Objectives

Learn concepts related to AIoT software.
Practice AIoT software development skills and tools.
Experience team software development using a case study.

# Scope:

# User stories and acceptance criteria:

### User Story 1:

As a parking lot manager, I want the system to detect the license plate number of vehicles entering the parking lot and check if the plate number is in the database. If the plate number is in the database, I want the system to open the barricade and allow the user to enter.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The system should be able to detect the license plate number of vehicles entering the parking lot
- The system should be able to check if the license plate number is in the database
- If the license plate number is in the database, the system should open the barricade and allow the user to enter the parking lot
- If the license plate number is not in the database, the system should not open the barricade and should display an error message.

### User Story 2:

As a parking lot manager, I want the system to use Bluetooth signal to double check that the passed user is not using a fake license plate.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The system should be able to detect Bluetooth signal of the user's device
- The system should be able to verify the signal with the license plate number detected by the camera
- If the Bluetooth signal matches with the detected license plate number, the user is allowed to enter the parking lot
- If the Bluetooth signal does not match with the detected license plate number, the user is not allowed to enter the parking lot and should display an error message.

### User Story 3:

As a parking lot manager, I want the system to maintain a record of vehicles entering and exiting the parking lot.

Acceptance Criteria:

- The system should maintain a record of license plate numbers and entry/exit timestamps of vehicles entering and exiting the parking lot
- The record should be stored in a database and be easily queryable
- The record should be secure and only accessible to authorized personnel.

### User Story 4:

As a parking lot user, I want to be able to easily enter and exit the parking lot using my registered license plate number and Bluetooth device.
Acceptance Criteria:

- The user should be able to register their license plate number and Bluetooth device with the system
- The user should be able to easily enter and exit the parking lot by having the system automatically detect their license plate number and Bluetooth signal
- The user should receive a confirmation message upon successful entry and exit.
